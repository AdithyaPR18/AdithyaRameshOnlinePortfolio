  <p>Project Title: Map It, Drive It<br>
Language: Vex Robotics<br>
Time: 2/5/2021 - 2/25/2021<br>

The goal for this project was to program a robot to be able to path find its way from a start point to an end point, all while avoiding obstacles, similar to a self driving car. To do this, the robot had to find alternatives to driving through the obstacles. We accomplished this by teaching the robot to turn and drive around an obstacle, to pass it, and then to continue on the path it had originally intended, as if the course had no obstacles. My team followed the Scrum format in order to achieve this goal. We documented all our sprints and retrospective. We also made a project log. This info can be found <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LzjDghJD8zcFnaWggvp5dcqbTCAO6_y5UBnu-U2ZUPY/edit" target = "_blank">here</a>. A demonstration of the program can be found below.

  Project Title: Hydrogen Fuel Cell Car<br>
Vex Materials<br>
Time: 1/15/2022 - 2/3/2022<br>

The goal for this project was to create a car that was powered by renewable or inexhaustible resources using our knowledge of simple machines and electrical circuits. After doing some testing our team found out that the most efficient way to power our car was using two hydrogen fuel cells. We ran tests on 8 different types of electrical configurations before deciding to use two hydrogen fuel cells. After finding out which electrical configuration worked best we had to design the actual car itself. When designing the car we encountered many more problems. First, we had to minimilize the weight of the entire car itself in order for the motor to be able to move the car. Our second problem was that there was no way to attach our breadboard and hydrogen fuel cells to the car. We had to use Vex parts to create a holder for the breadboard and the hydrogen fuel cells. Finally we had to reduce the friction that was placed on the axle and the wheel. We were able to accomplish this by using the Scrum process to organize and document our work. Our documentation can be viewed <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bb5FdvtfDMO-OAwem7sp0woidnXv8MlKtPiolrMOvyM/edit?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">here.</a>
