  <p>Project Title: Map It, Drive It<br>
Language: Vex Robotics<br>
Time: 2/5/2021 - 2/25/2021<br>
Course: Computer Science Essentials<br>

The goal for this project was to program a robot to be able to path find its way from a start point to an end point, all while avoiding obstacles, similar to a self driving car. To do this, the robot had to find alternatives to driving through the obstacles. We accomplished this by teaching the robot to turn and drive around an obstacle, to pass it, and then to continue on the path it had originally intended, as if the course had no obstacles. My team followed the Scrum format in order to achieve this goal. We documented all our sprints and retrospective. We also made a project log. This info can be found <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LzjDghJD8zcFnaWggvp5dcqbTCAO6_y5UBnu-U2ZUPY/edit" target = "_blank">here</a>. A demonstration of the program can be found on the side.

  Project Title: Creative Expression<br>
Language: MIT App Inventor<br>
Time: 10/20/2020 - 11/15/2020<br>
Course: Computer Science Essentials<br>

The goal for this project was to create an android application that was affected by real world events. For this project, my partner and I tried to find important real world events to base the app off of. We finally decided on of the biggest and most life-changing event of that year, the COVID-19 pandemic. We decided to make the game very simple for people to understand. We based it off of Space Invaders. The hand sanitizer bottle was a gun and the virus falling from the air was coronavirus. Players had three lives and had to shoot the falling coronavirus using the hand sanitizer bottle which would squirt hand sanitizer. We had also originally planned to have three levels, easy, medium, and hard. Throughout these levels new features would be added. After creating the basic idea for the project we realized that most people already knew about the hand sanitizer and the pandemic, so we decided to add features that would teach people. For example, in the planning for the hard difficulty we added a 6 foot line, and if the coronavirus got past the 6 foot line, the player would start to lose hearts. After finishing these changes we realized that the game was too confusing with all the different levels and different rules, so we combined all the different levels into one, and only changed the game mode depending on how many points the player had and how well they were doing. We documented all our work using the Scrum process which can be found here. A video demonstrating the app can be found here.

  Project Title: Hydrogen Fuel Cell Car<br>
Vex Materials<br>
Time: 1/15/2022 - 2/3/2022<br>
Course: Principles of Engineering<br>

The goal for this project was to create a car that was powered by renewable or inexhaustible resources using our knowledge of simple machines and electrical circuits. After doing some testing our team found out that the most efficient way to power our car was using two hydrogen fuel cells. We ran tests on 8 different types of electrical configurations before deciding to use two hydrogen fuel cells. After finding out which electrical configuration worked best we had to design the actual car itself. When designing the car we encountered many more problems. First, we had to minimilize the weight of the entire car itself in order for the motor to be able to move the car. Our second problem was that there was no way to attach our breadboard and hydrogen fuel cells to the car. We had to use Vex parts to create a holder for the breadboard and the hydrogen fuel cells. Finally we had to reduce the friction that was placed on the axle and the wheel. We were able to accomplish this by using the Scrum process to organize and document our work.

  Project Title: Glider Design Project<br>
Materials: Balsa wood, glue, scissors, sandpaper<br>
Time: 10/15/2022 - 12/16/2022<br>
Course: Aerospace Engineering<br>

The goal of the Glider Design Project was to design and build a glider using balsa wood and other simple materials to achieve the longest flight distance possible. The project was done in the Aerospace Engineering course, and we were required to apply our knowledge of aerodynamics to create a glider that could fly through the air with the least amount of resistance.

The first step in the project was to research the principles of aerodynamics and the factors that affect flight. We studied the concept of lift, drag, weight, and thrust, and how they relate to glider design. Then, we analyzed the design of existing gliders and reviewed their features and advantages.

Next, we began building our gliders. We used balsa wood to create the framework of the glider and then sanded it to ensure a smooth surface. We also used scissors to shape the wings and tail sections, and glue to hold everything together. We made sure to keep the weight of the glider as low as possible, as this is essential for a long flight.

After completing the construction of the glider, we tested them by throwing them in the air and measuring the distance they traveled. We then made adjustments to the design and repeated the process until we achieved the best possible results.

Throughout the project, we used the engineering design process to ensure that we were creating a glider that was both efficient and effective. We documented our work and presented our findings to the class, sharing our design choices and explaining the rationale behind them.

Overall, the Glider Design Project provided a hands-on learning experience in aerospace engineering, allowing us to apply our knowledge of aerodynamics and design principles to create a functional and efficient glider.Our documentation can be viewed <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1brbw6_jtH1FC_lGcUlR7I0FXzWwjOLvBF-Sb08gSSVY/edit?usp=sharing" target = "_blank">here.</a>

  Project Title: Airfoil Construction and Airfoil Design<br>
Materials: Foam, balsa wood, sandpaper, hot wire cutter, CAD software<br>
Time: 9/20/2022 - 12/16/2022<br>
Course: Aerospace Engineering<br>

The Airfoil Construction and Airfoil Design project was a two-part project in the Aerospace Engineering course. The goal of the project was to design and construct an airfoil, which is the shape of an airplane wing, and to analyze its performance through wind tunnel testing.

The first part of the project was the airfoil construction. We started by researching the principles of airfoil design and the factors that affect their performance. We then used computer-aided design (CAD) software to create a three-dimensional model of our airfoil. We made sure to consider the shape, size, and surface characteristics of the airfoil.

After designing our airfoil, we moved on to the construction phase. We used foam and balsa wood to build the framework of the airfoil. We used a hot wire cutter to shape the foam, and sandpaper to ensure a smooth surface. We made sure to maintain the correct dimensions and angles of the airfoil to ensure optimal performance.

The second part of the project was the airfoil design. We used the wind tunnel to test the performance of our airfoil. We tested different angles of attack, which is the angle at which the airfoil meets the air, to determine the lift and drag characteristics of the airfoil. We also tested different airspeeds to observe the airfoil's performance at different velocities.

Based on the wind tunnel testing, we made adjustments to our airfoil design. We analyzed the data and made modifications to the shape, size, and surface characteristics of the airfoil to improve its performance.

Throughout the project, we applied the engineering design process to ensure that we were creating an airfoil that was both efficient and effective. We documented our work and presented our findings to the class, sharing our design choices and explaining the rationale behind them.

Overall, the Airfoil Construction and Airfoil Design project provided a hands-on learning experience in aerospace engineering, allowing us to apply our knowledge of airfoil design and principles to create a functional and efficient airfoil. You can find the documentation for Airfoil Design
