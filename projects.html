  <p>Project Title: Map It, Drive It<br>
Language: Vex Robotics<br>
Time: 2/5/2021 - 2/25/2021<br>

The goal for this project was to program a robot to be able to path find its way from a start point to an end point, all while avoiding obstacles, similar to a self driving car. To do this, the robot had to find alternatives to driving through the obstacles. We accomplished this by teaching the robot to turn and drive around an obstacle, to pass it, and then to continue on the path it had originally intended, as if the course had no obstacles. My team followed the Scrum format in order to achieve this goal. We documented all our sprints and retrospective. We also made a project log. This info can be found here. A demonstration of the program can be found here.

  Project Title: Creative Expression<br>
Language: MIT App Inventor<br>
Time: 10/20/2020 - 11/15/2020<br>

The goal for this project was to create an android application that was affected by real world events. For this project, my partner and I tried to find important real world events to base the app off of. We finally decided on of the biggest and most life-changing event of that year, the COVID-19 pandemic. We decided to make the game very simple for people to understand. We based it off of Space Invaders. The hand sanitizer bottle was a gun and the virus falling from the air was coronavirus. Players had three lives and had to shoot the falling coronavirus using the hand sanitizer bottle which would squirt hand sanitizer. We had also originally planned to have three levels, easy, medium, and hard. Throughout these levels new features would be added. After creating the basic idea for the project we realized that most people already knew about the hand sanitizer and the pandemic, so we decided to add features that would teach people. For example, in the planning for the hard difficulty we added a 6 foot line, and if the coronavirus got past the 6 foot line, the player would start to lose hearts. After finishing these changes we realized that the game was too confusing with all the different levels and different rules, so we combined all the different levels into one, and only changed the game mode depending on how many points the player had and how well they were doing. We documented all our work using the Scrum process which can be found here. A video demonstrating the app can be found here.
