  <h2 class="title-of-content-area" style="font-family: 'Aleo', serif;">Career Exploration</h2>
  
  <div class="content-area-text">

<p> Throughout highschool, I have gained alot of experience and knowledge in engineering careers. A very vital part in my career exploration journey was taking Principles of Engineering (POE). POE is a class that exposes students to many different career fields available in the engineering field. I took this course after Computer Science Essentials in order to figure out what type of engineering I wanted to specialize in. During POE, we covered 2D kinematics, which was an aerospace engineering unit. This unit intrested me alot. Currently, I am debating between pursuing the computer science field and the aerospace engineering field.
</p>
  
<p><br>
  During POE, I went on a field trip and visited the Patriots Jet Team Lab. This course helped show me the future of the aerospace engineering field, which is something very important I have to consider, because if i do pursue aerospace engineering, I would be working on advancing the field. On the field trip, I got to learn alot about a company called Volansi. Volansi is a company building electronic flight vehicles, such as drones. Some of their drones had autonomous navigation and are predicted to help conglomerate companies with transportations of their materials.
</p>

<p> <br>
  Another time I gained experience was when I helped a nonprofit organization called Youth Coding Workshops or YCW. Working with them, I was able to help many students learn essentials of computer programming for free. I was a curriculum designer and was mainly tasked with creating programming problems in Python for them to solve. I was also included in YCW's biggest project, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KT_WuuYpLSQ"> YCW Space Odyssey. </a> It helped me understand how higher level projects in bigger companies were organized. I also got to meet many different people needed for the project, such as music producers, front end developers, back end developers, voice actors, marketing directors and more. YCW gave me alot of exposure and helped me understand how to collaborate and communicate with many other computer programmers. It also helped increase my interest and skill in computer programming. 
</p>
<p> <br>
  Finally, POE taught me about jobs in which both aerospace knowledge and computer science knowledge must be used. A prime example of this was Net Logo. In POE, I used NetLogo to develop simulations and track the flight patterns of different rockets, in order to understand what the most optimal path of flight would be. I am taking aerospace engineer and am hoping it will help me decide whether I want to do, aerospace engineering, computer science, or a job that requires skills from both.
