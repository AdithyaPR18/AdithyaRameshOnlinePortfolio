  <p>Like millions of other people, I am a young student, hoping to have a future in engineering. I want to work for big tech companies such as Google and Apple. But more importantly, I want to be a software engineer, so that I can help shape the future of how humans conduct their every day lives. Technology has always fascinated me, by every aspect of it, but making these gadgets, is something I never wondered about, until I became older. After becoming older, I realized that, there is more to technology, than the latest iPhone or the fastest car. Making these objects, quickly caught my interest, but more specifically software development caught my interest. I was fascinated about how the Google search engine could bring the 1.2 billion websites in existence, to the tip of my fingers, within milliseconds, or how Apple was able to revolutionize the future of the smart home, using the Apple ecosystem. In order to pursue a career in this field, during 8th grade I decided to finally finish the HTML tutorial that I never finished, and I did. I then went on to learn Python and then enrolled into my high school computer science class, in which I learned, the thought process behind programming, such as creating  path finding algorithms, and I got to learn the depths of CSS. Using the knowledge, I had I decided to put together this website, and to update it often in order, to help pursue my dreams of becoming a software engineer.
</p>
<p><br>
  When I started learning programming, I wasn’t many things. For starters, I wasn’t open-minded or self motivated, and these were big traits I needed to have in order to pursue my dreams, but I couldn’t just force myself to have these traits, I had to learn to have these traits. For a long time of my life, I didn’t have these traits. I would stop learning a programming language in the middle of the course, or I wouldn’t listen to what others had to say about my code. It took me from the end of 5th to the start of 8th grade, to get a pretty good understanding of HTML, and then it took me about a year, to get a simple understanding of Python. This was when I enrolled in my high school computer science course. The first unit in this course was block-coding. We learned how to block code, and then at the end of the unit we did a group project. I had originally thought that this wasn’t going to help me at all, because block coding isn’t used in the industry, but what I didn’t realize is that throughout the group projects we had that unit, I had learned to have a self-motivated mindset to learn and I was open-minded. I was able to listen to feedback others had and was able to motivate myself to do work, but not only did I learn that I was self-motivated and open-minded, but I also learned that I could grow if I put my mind to it. Up until this point, I had never believed in the growth mindset, but this experience showed me otherwise. It encouraged me to take up other opportunities to improve myself, such as leadership positions in my boy scout troop, and it pushed me to put my programming skills to use.
</p>
<p> <br>
  Throughout my life, I never had completely decided where I want to work, even today. All I know, is that I want to have a job in software development for top companies such as Google and Amazon. I learned many skills to guide me through it such as learning HTML and Python, but I also made many achievements along my path in order to get where I am today. For example, in 4th grade, I learned about the stock market. I learned how stocks work. I then enrolled into my schools’s stock market game, which was a nationwide stock market competition for elementary schoolers. I placed 2nd place in the entire nation, which consisted about 1000 schools. I was then featured in the news and was given a completely complimentary trip, to the bank of america building in San Francisco, in which I gave a speech. I went on to learn and improve my knowledge about the stock market, which increased my interest in crypto currency as well. This helped me with learning about programming, because it allowed me to learn how stocks can affect companies in real time, and it taught me about events such as the 2008 stock market crash. Throughout my life, I always saw myself as an ordinary kid, but when I put more focus into it, I learned that I could achieve what I wanted to if I put my mind to it. With that in mind, I am currently learning to become a software engineer, and one day hope to have a good job in software development, that will allow me to live freely without any constraints, in budget or location.
